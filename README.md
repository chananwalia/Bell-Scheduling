# Bell-Scheduling
This application can be utilized to set a school's schedule for the day online and then have the schedule be displayed on monitors around campus. There is a web and a local component. The web component lets users see and edit the current schedule in an intuitive manner, and the local component uses the web API to get the current schedule and builds a PNG that provides a clean, readable schedule that can be displayed on monitors around a school's campus. The app was created for a final project for a Data Structures Honors class at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, CA.
